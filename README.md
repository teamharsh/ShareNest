Sure, here's a single `README.md` file for setting up the ShareNest project:

```markdown
# ShareNest

ShareNest is a file sharing application built with React and Node.js.

## Setup

### Client

1. Navigate to the client folder:

   ```bash
   cd ShareNest/client
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Server

1. Navigate to the server folder:

   ```bash
   cd ShareNest/server
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file:

   ```bash
   touch .env
   ```

3. Open the `.env` file and add the following:

   ```dotenv
   PORT=8000
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri
   ```

   Replace `your_mongodb_uri` with your MongoDB URI.

4. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

Now, you should have both the client and server running.
